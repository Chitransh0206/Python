a = input("Enter number 1: ")

print("Number a is: ", a)

print("Sum/Concat of a and b is: ", a + b)  # This will concatenate strings, not add numbers
# To perform addition, we need to convert inputs to integers or floats

print("Sum of a and b is: ", int(a) + int(b))  # This will add the numbers correctly
